## Era

### AGE OF INFORMATION (Search Engines)
- This age focuses on finding information, mainly through search engines.
- Information
    - Emphasis is on data and facts
    - Users look for answers rather than meaning
- Mechanistic
    - Interaction feels machine-like
    - Fixed inputs → fixed outputs
- Single Interaction
    - One question → one result
    - No ongoing conversation
- We Synthesize
    - Humans must combine and interpret information themselves
    - We Conform to Computers
- Users adapt to keywords, syntax, and rules
    - Example: learning how to “Google properly”
- Content Created by Humans
    - Articles, blogs, websites written by people
    - Computers mainly retrieve, not create
- Knowing, Memorizing Facts
    - Value placed on remembering information
    - Learning = storing facts in memory

    - Reduces cognitive overload for humans
- Computers Conform to Us

    - No need for strict commands or keywords
- Content Created by Machines
    - AI generates text, images, code, and ideas
    - Machines become creative collaborators
- Applying, Accessing, and Using Facts
    - Focus on how to use knowledge
    - Learning = problem-solving and decision-making
