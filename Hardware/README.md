# Hardware
- Physical components of a computer system (CPU, memory, storage devices, motherboard, input/output devices).

## Computer Remembering
- Motherboard: the main printed circuit board (PCB) that connects and powers the CPU, memory, storage and I/O devices; provides expansion slots and device interfaces.
- CPU: Central Processing Unit; executes program instructions and performs arithmetic/logic operations — the computer's primary processor.
- RAM: Random Access Memory; volatile, fast storage used by the CPU to hold active programs and data (cleared on power loss).
- ROM: Read-Only Memory; non-volatile memory that stores firmware or boot code (not typically overwritten during normal operation).

## Secondary Storage 
- persistent, non-volatile storage used for long-term data retention. 
- Common categories:
  - Solid State: flash-based storage (fast, no moving parts).
    - SSD: Solid State Drive; high-performance internal flash storage.
    - Flash Drive: removable USB flash storage for convenient file transfer.
    - Micro SD: removable flash memory card used in phones, cameras, and small devices.
  - Magnetic: uses magnetic media; generally higher capacity and lower cost per GB.
    - HDD: Hard Disk Drive; spinning-platter magnetic storage for large-capacity persistent storage.
    - Tape: magnetic tape used for archival backup and long-term retention.
  - Optical: laser-readable discs used for distribution and backup.
    - CD: Compact Disc; optical medium for audio/data distribution.
    - DVD: Digital Versatile Disc; higher-capacity optical medium than CD.

## Usb Cables
- Overview: USB (Universal Serial Bus) is a common standard for data transfer and power delivery between devices.
- Connector types:
  - USB-A: rectangular host-side connector commonly found on older PCs and chargers.
  - USB-B: square-ish connector used by some printers and legacy peripherals.
  - Micro-USB: small connector used on many older phones and devices.
  - USB-C: small, reversible connector that supports high-speed data, power delivery, and alternate modes (video).
- Versions and typical speeds:
  - USB 1.x: up to 12 Mbps (Low/Full Speed).
  - USB 2.0: up to 480 Mbps (High Speed).
  - USB 3.x: 5 Gbps, 10 Gbps, or higher (SuperSpeed / SuperSpeed+ depending on generation).
  - USB4 / Thunderbolt: up to 40 Gbps (implementation-dependent).
- Power and charging:
  - Basic USB supplies 5V; current and voltage limits vary by port and cable.
  - USB Power Delivery (PD) negotiates higher voltages/currents over USB-C for fast charging.
- Practical notes:
  - Not all cables support every speed or PD — quality and wiring matter.
  - A USB-C connector does not guarantee USB4/Thunderbolt speeds; check cable and device specs.
  - USB On-The-Go (OTG) allows some devices to act as hosts for peripherals.
  - For high-bandwidth or power-hungry uses, choose certified, short, high-quality cables.
