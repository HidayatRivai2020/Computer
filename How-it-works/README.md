# How It Works

## The Physical Side of Technology
- A computer works using electrical signals that flow through tiny physical components inside the machine.

### Circuits
- paths made of wires and components that allow electricity to flow.
- Carry electrical signals (on / off)
- Connect different parts of the computer
- Found on the motherboard and chips
- Without circuits, electricity cannot move inside a computer.

### Switches
- control whether electricity flows or stops.
- Two states: ON (1) and OFF (0)
- Form the basis of binary logic
- Millions of tiny switches exist inside a CPU
- Computers use switches to represent data as 1s and 0s.

### Transistors
- Transistors are tiny electronic switches that turn electricity on or off automatically.
- Much smaller and faster than mechanical switches
- Billions are packed into modern CPUs
- Perform logic operations and calculations
- Transistors are the heart of modern computers.

### How they work together
- Circuits carry electricity
- Transistors act as switches
- On = 1, Off = 0
- Billions of these operations happen every second

## Coding Scheme
- A coding scheme is a method used to represent data (letters, numbers, symbols) in a form that a computer can store, process, and transmit, usually using binary (0 and 1).
- Purpose:
  - Convert human-readable data into machine-readable form
  - Ensure accuracy and consistency
  - Enable data storage, processing, and communication


### ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
- Represents letters, numbers, symbols
- Example: A = 65

### Unicode
- Supports many languages worldwide
- Used in modern systems (UTF-8)

### Binary Code
- Uses only 0 and 1
- Foundation of all computer data

### BCD (Binary Coded Decimal)
- Each decimal digit coded in binary

## Data units
- Standard measurements used to show how much information a computer can store or process.
- Purpose:
  - Measure storage capacity
  - Measure file size
  - Measure memory usage 


##@ Bit
- (b)
- Smallest unit of data
- Can be 0 or 1

### Nibble
- 4 bits
- Half a byte

### Byte
- (B)
- 8 bits
- Represents one character (e.g., A)

### Kilobyte
- (KB)
- 1,024 bytes
- Small text files

### Megabyte
- (MB)
- 1,024 KB
- Images, short audio files

### Gigabyte 
- (GB)
- 1,024 MB
- Videos, apps, games

### Terabyte
- (TB)
- 1,024 GB
- Large backups, databases

### Petabyte
- (PB)
- 1,024 TB
- Data centers, big data

### Exabyte
- (EB)
- 1,024 PB
- Global-scale data storage

### Zettabyte
- (ZB)
- 1,024 EB
- Internet-scale data

### Yottabyte
- (YB)
- 1,024 ZB
- Theoretical / future usage
