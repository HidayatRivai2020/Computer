# Architecture

## Application Architecture
- Composite Architecture 
- Evolving Architecture 
- Hybrid Architecture 
- Modular Architecture

### Distributed Application
- Use many smaller application instead of one big monolith
- `UNIX philosophy` : simple commands that only do one thing and do that thing all the time
- Spreads the components of the application across multiple networked nodes, enabling scalability, fault tolerance, and parallel processing
- commonly used in client-server, microservices, service-oriented architecture (SOA), and peer-to-peer (P2P) networking architecture

## Architectural Style
- Client-Server Architecture 
- Component-Based Architecture 
- Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
- Layered Architecture 
- N-Tier Architecture 
- Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture 
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Space-Based Architecture
- [Microservice Architecture](https://github.com/HidayatRivai2020/microservice/)

### Monolithic Application
- Everything is built into a single application.
- Everything exists in one code base and compiles to one binary
